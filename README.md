# Kanban Mouse

A terminal-based Kanban board using Laravel Prompts, inspired by [Joe Tannenbaum's blog post](https://blog.joe.codes/hacking-laravel-prompts-for-fun-and-profit).

**But** now with 100% more mouse support. Whether it's sensible or not.

## Use locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ashleyhindle/kanban-mouse.git
cd kanban-mouse
composer install

php kanban.php
```

# Purpose
This is really just to show how to do it, what's available, and what's possible.

It's not production ready, it's not an app you should use to manage your todos.

It's a demo of what's possible if you ignore your other life commitments.

## Most interesting files
- `app/Mouse.php`
- `app/MouseEvent.php`
- `app/Kanban.php`
